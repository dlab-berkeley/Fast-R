# Navigating RStudio
## By default, this script will open in the upper left pane of RStudio. Open a new script by clicking File --> New File --> R Script

## 1. Script: this is your input and is easily savable
## 2. Console: output appears here and functions as a nice scratch space
## 3. Global Environment: saved variables will appear here
## 4. Misc: navigate your file system, plots, install packages, view help

# Variable Assignment
## We save data in R's memory by storing them in placeholders called "variables", which can be called and manipulated. 

x <- 5  # assign the variable
x       # print it to your console

y <- log(2.4)
y

z <- x / y
z

# Functions and arguments
## Functions: perform actions on things
## Arguments: the "things"

# Data types
## The class() function checks the class ("type") of a variable. There are five basic types for data, listed below.

## 1. Numeric type - 64-bit floating point numbers (decimals); the default for all numbers in R, even numbers that look like integers:
class(x)

## 2. Integer - whole numbers, positive and negative (including zero). Use the as.integer() function to convert it:
x_int <- as.integer(x)
x_int
class(x_int)

## 3. Character - character string data; always wrapped in quotations:
x_char <- as.character(x)
x_char
class(x_char)

## 4. Logical - TRUE and FALSE only; used for logical testing, data subsetting, and turning function parameters "on" and "off"

"Berkeley" == "berkeley"  # equivalent to (remember, R is case sensitive)
8 != 7                    # not equivalent to
3 > 2                     # greater than
9 <= 9                    # less than/equal to

mean(c(1, 5, 7, NA, 8))   # NA

## Using the help files:
?mean

mean(c(1, 5, 7, NA, 8), na.rm = TRUE)

## 5. Factor - synonymous with categorical type (can be nominal or ordinal)

## Deleting variables
### First, view the variables saved in your global environment:
ls()

### Delete x
rm(x)

ls() # x has been removed

### You can also wipe your Global Environment clean by clicking the broom on your "Environment" tab in the upper-right pane of your RStudio session.

# Data structures
## Vector: an ordered group of the SAME type of data. These will be the columns/variables in your data frames and spreadsheets.
Name <- c("Max", "Tito", "Bella", "Tessa", "Milley")
Name
class(Name)

Age <- c(5, 9, 12, 2, 6)
Age
class(Age)

# Indexing: means to refer to part of a data scructure by position. R is a one-indexed language and begins counting at the number 1. 

## If we want to extract the third name from the Name vector, we could type:
Name[3]

## If we want to extract the second, third, and fourth names: 
Name[2:4]

# Data Frame: an ordered group of EQUAL-LENGTH vectors!
animals <- data.frame(Name, Age)
animals
class(animals)

# Import data
## There are many different ways to import data into R, which can handle data of virtually every format. We will stick with .csv (comma-separated values) files for now. 

## The easiest way to import data is to: 
## 1. Click the "Import Dataset" button at the top of your "Environment" tab in the upper-right pane of RStudio
## 2. Then click "From Text (base)..."
## 3. Navigate your file system to the "Fast-R" folder you downloaded/cloned earlier
## 4. Select "gapminder.FiveYearData.csv", and a dialog box appears
## 5. Rename the "Name" field to gap and click "Import". 
## You should now see the dataset in its entirety pop up in a new tab. This is done by using the View() function.

str(gap)      # displays the compact structure of the data frame
head(gap)     # shows the first six rows by default
dim(gap)      # show row x col dimensions 
nrow(gap)     # print number of rows
ncol(gap)     # display number of columns
colnames(gap) # display column names
rownames(gap) # display row names

# Subseting in one dimension
## Use the dollar sign to extract just one column from a data frame. First, just type gap$ and press the tab key - the names of the columns will appear as a vector! 

## To extract just the lifeExp column, we could type
gap$lifeExp

## This is useful because we can immediately plug it into something else:
?hist
hist(gap$lifeExp)                     # histogram

?cor.test
cor.test(gap$lifeExp, gap$gdpPercap)  # Pearson correlation

# Subsetting in two dimensions with bracket notation
## Extracting a single column is good, but slicing rows and columns might be better. Remember how we indexed a vector earlier? We wil do the same thing here, but will type the name of the dataset followed by square brackets separated by a comma. Like this:

## gap[rows, cols]

## If we just want rows 5 thru 9 and columns 2 thru 4 we could type:
gap_small <- gap[5:9, 2:4]
gap_small

## ... but for discontinuous subsets we need to use c(). If we want rows 5 thru 9 and 17 along with columns 2 thru 4 and 6, we could type: 
gap_small2 <- gap[c(5:9, 17), c(2:4, 6)]
gap_small2 

# Do we have the proper rows and columns?
colnames(gap)

# Visualization
## Use data visualizations to communicate potentially complex phenomena in easy to understand ways. 

## Base graphics - these graphical funcions come with the base installation of R

### Histogram: illustrate the distribution of one continuous (i.e., numeric or integer) variable:

### Default rendering:
hist(gap$lifeExp)

### Customizations
hist(gap$lifeExp, # data to be plotted
     col = "skyblue", # bar color
     main = "Life Expectancy", # title
     xlab = "Years", # x-axis label
     ylab = "Count", # y-axis label
     xlim = c(20, 90), # x-axis limits
     ylim = c(0,400), # y-axis limits
     las = 1) # Label Axis Style

### Boxplots: display distribution of a continuous variable, but parsed by a factor (think of the tilde as meaning "by"). The other graphical parameters apply here as well:
boxplot(gap$lifeExp ~ gap$continent)

### Scatterplot: display the distributions of two continuous variables - one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis:
plot(x = gap$lifeExp, 
     y = gap$gdpPercap)

## ggplot2
### Base plotting is good, but the ggplot2 way is better! Manipulating margins, legends, and point colors can be cumbersome. Thankfully, ggplot2 helps us produce publication ready figures more efficiently. 

### First, install the ggplot2 package. This physically downloads the files to your computer from CRAN: 
install.packages("ggplot2")

### ... however, your current R session does not know they are there. Second, import the ggplot2 files into your current session:
library(ggplot2)

### Test that your installation and import was successful by checking the help files:
?ggplot2

# Statistical testing

# Mini project - A research workflow: 

How might you start a research project? Below is a template to help you get started:
  
  **1. Read literature in your field** What questions could the authors not answer? In which directions do they think research should go? What are your insights? 
  
  **2. Develop a research question** Use your domain expertise to brainstorm a few questions that, from a research perspective, are reasonable/doable/testable. 

**3. Turn your research question into a set of testable hypotheses** (if null/alternate hypothesis testing is your goal)

**4. Develop data collection protocols/acquire data** Develop protocols for data collection or otherwise acquire data (from your advisor, fieldwork, surveys, API, webscraping, etc.)

**5. Import the data into R** via `read.csv()`, the import dataset button, the [rio R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/readme/README.html), etc.

**6. Clean/subset the data**
  
  **7. Explore, summarize, and visualize the data** 
  
  **8. Analysis**  (exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, machine learning, etc.)

**9. Draw conclusions based on this process** to add discussion to relevant bodies of knowledge in your field.
